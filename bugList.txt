8/21/21:
	- status effects carry over to other Nommers

8/28/20:
	FIXED (turns out I forgot to switch the "no" to a "none" in the .txt file oops)
		- when using heal it gives the other Nommer
			a "no" status effect
				- Prevents from getting another status effect added because it
					is occupied by the "no"
